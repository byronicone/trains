# trains
Finding the optimal routes for railways between cities in Kiwiland

##Problem Statement

##Design Considerations
Directed Graph
Adjacency Matrix vs List?

###TODO
Add method to add routes instead of doing it inline (for clarity)
use push instead of replacing whole map for modifying neighbors
BFS vs DFS for graph? explain what you've done
Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path (optional: use fibonacci heap)
